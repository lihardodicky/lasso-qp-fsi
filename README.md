# Constrained Lasso with Quadratic Programming Approach: Optimizing Variable Selection for Food Security Index in JavaÂ Island

This project is intended for the fulfilment of our lecture courses, regarding the final assignment project-based learning program. Yash, I just want to share it widely through this medium article.

First of all, we must know more about LASSO. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator is a development of Ridge regression which was successfully developed and introduced for the first time in 1996 by Tibshirani. This method is used to shrink the regression coefficients of predictor variables that have a high correlation with errors, to be exactly at zero or close to zero. The main key, LASSO used for independent variable selection, so that only the best variables will be included in the model.

Constrained LASSO is a very flexible framework for involving additional structures in the estimation of LASSO coefficients. Additional constraints on these coefficients serve to control the complexity of the model and will affect the variable selection process, one of which is through the Quadratic Programming approach. There are also other algorithms to solve Constrained LASSO, including the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) and a novel path-following algorithm.
